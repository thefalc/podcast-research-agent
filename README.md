# Podcast Research Agent
If you're a podcast host, this application does the topic and guest research for you. Enter the URLs
you want to use as source material including other podcast and Youtube links, and the agent will
pull in the audio, convert it to text, and store it in a vector database. The most relevant context
is passed to a LLM to generate a podcast brief and set of suggested questions.
